# Assignment:

# What are Design Patterns and why do we need them?

*Design Patterns* are fundamental part of software development, as they provide typical solutions to commonly recurring problems in software design. Rather than providing specific pieces of software.
*Design Patterns* are merely concepts that can be used to handle recurring themes in an optimized way.

Popularized by the "Gang of Four" (GoF) in their book [*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*](https://github.com/GunterMueller/Books-3/blob/master/Design%20Patterns%20Elements%20of%20Reusable%20Object-Oriented%20Software.pdf), these patterns offer tried-and-tested ways to approach challenges in coding.

Design patterns fall into three broad categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
2. **Structural Patterns**: Focus on the composition of classes or objects (e.g., Adapter, Composite).
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on object interaction and communication (e.g., Observer, Command).
